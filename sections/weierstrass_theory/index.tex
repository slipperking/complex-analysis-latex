\section{The Theory of Weierstrass}
While Weierstrass' contributions in complex analysis are mainly characterized
by his discoveries on uniform convergence, he also characterized entire and
\textscsl{meromorphic functions} and a unique representation of entire
functions, as well as his contributions toward the study of \textscsl{essential
singularities}.

To classify the behavior of non-removable singularities, mathematicians
generalized Taylor series to \textscsl{Laurent series}.
