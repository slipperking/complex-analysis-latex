\section{Prerequisites}
\subsection{Topological Preliminaries}
We will provide a rough, informal notion of important topological concepts tailored specifically towards complex analysis.
\begin{definition}[Closure of a Set]\label{def:closure}
    For a set \(X\in\mathbb{C}^n\), define the \textit{closure} of \(X\), or \(\overline{X}\) to be the intersection of all closed sets containing \(X\). In other words, it is the union of \(X\) and every accumulation point (a point \(z\in\mathbb{C}^n\) is an accumulation point of \(X\) if for any open set \(U\) containing \(z\), \((U\setminus\{z\})\cap X\neq\emptyset\)).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Interior of a Set]\label{def:interior}
    For a set \(X\in\mathbb{C}^n\), the \textit{interior} of \(X\), denoted \(X^\circ\), is the union of all open sets contained in \(X\), or the set of points \(z\in\mathbb{C}^n\) such that there exists an open neighborhood of \(z\) that is fully contained in \(X\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Compact Set]\label{def:compactsets}
    A set \(X\in\mathbb{C}^n\) is compact if and only if \(X\) is closed and bounded.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Cover of a Set]
    A cover \(\mathcal{C}\) of a set \(X\) is a collection of sets \(\cbraces{U_n}\) such that \[\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}U_n\supseteq X.\] A cover is \textit{open} if every set in the collection is open.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Bolzano--Weierstrass Theorem]\label{thm:bolzanoweierstrass}
    Every infinite subset \(A\) of a compact set \(X\subset\mathbb{C}^n\) has an accumulation point in \(X\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(X\) is bounded, there exists a closed cube \(Q\subset\mathbb{C}^n\) such that \(A\subseteq X\subset Q\).

    Bisect \(Q_0=Q\) into \(2^{2n}\) congruent sub-cubes. Since \(A\) is infinite and the sub-cubes are finite in number, at least one of the sub-cubes contains infinitely many points of \(A\), and choose one to be \(Q_1\).

    Bisect \(Q_1\) into \(2^{2n}\) sub-cubes, and choose a sub-cube \(Q_2\subset Q_1\) that contains infinitely many points of \(A\). We then obtain the recursive sequence \[Q_0\supset Q_1 \supset Q_2\supset\cdots.\]

    Because the side lengths shrink to zero and the cubes are nested, the intersection
    \[\bigcap_{k=0}^{\infty} Q_k\]
    consists of exactly one point. Call this point \(z_\infty\in\mathbb{C}^n\).

    For each \(k\), \(Q_k\) contains infinitely many points of \(A\). Because the side length of \(Q_k\) tends to zero, for any \(\varepsilon>0\), \(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall k\geq N\), \(Q_k\subset D(z_\infty,\varepsilon)\) where \(D(a,b)\) is the poly disk with radius \(b\) centered at \(a\). Then, \(D(z_\infty, \varepsilon)\) also contains infinitely many points of \(A\). Therefore, \(z_\infty\) is an accumulation point of \(A\).

    We now show that \(z_\infty\in X\). Suppose for contradiction that \(z_\infty\notin X\). Since \(X\) is closed, \(\mathbb{C}^n\setminus X\) is open, and \(\exists\delta>0\) such that \[D(z_\infty,\delta)\subset\mathbb{C}^n\setminus X.\] But then, for sufficiently large \(k\), we have \(Q_k \subset D(z_\infty, \delta)\), and hence \(Q_k \cap X = \emptyset\). This contradicts the construction of \(Q_k\), which ensures that \(Q_k\) contains infinitely many points of \(A \subset X\).
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Heine-Borel Theorem]\label{thm:heineborel}
    A set \(X\in\mathbb{C}^n\) is compact if and only if every open cover has a finite subcover.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We will first show that any set satisfying the condition is compact.

    First we will show that \(X\) is bounded. Suppose that \(\forall R>0\), \(\exists z\in X\) where \(\|z\|>R\). Consider the collection of open sets \[\mathcal{U}=\{D(0,k)\mid k\in\mathbb{N}\}.\] \(\mathcal{U}\) forms an open cover of \(X\). Then there exists a finite subcover \(\{D(0,k_1),\ldots,D(0,k_m)\}\) covering \(X\). Then, \[X\subseteq\bigcup_{i=1}^mD(0,k_i)=D(0,\max(k_1,\ldots k_m)).\] By contradiction, \(X\) must be bounded.

    \(X\) must also be a closed set. For the sake of contradiction, assume that there exists a point \(z_0\in\overline{X}\setminus X\). Since \(z_0\notin X\), the following open collection of sets covers \(X\):
    \[\mathcal{U}=\left\{\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\overline{B}\left(z_0,\frac{1}{k}\right)\;\middle|\; \forall k\in\mathbb{N}\right\}.\] By assumption, there exists a finite subcover \(\mathcal{C}=\left\{\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\overline{B}\left(z_0,\frac{1}{k_i}\right)\;\middle|\; i=1,2,\ldots,m\right\}\). Then, \[X\subseteq\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\overline{B}\left(z_0,\frac{1}{\max(k_1,\ldots,k_m)}\right),\]
    and that \(X\cap\overline{B}\left(z_0,\frac{1}{\max(k_1,\ldots,k_m)}\right)=\emptyset\). However, by the definition of the accumulation point, every open neighborhood of the accumulation point must intersect \(X\). Therefore, by contradiction, \(X\) is closed.

    We then prove the converse. By the assumption that \(X\) is bounded, \(\exists R>0\) such that the \(X\) is contained within the closed cube \[Q=\left\{z\;\middle|\; z\in\mathbb{C}^n, \max_{i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}}\abs{\real(z_i)}\le R,\max_{i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}}\abs{\imaginary(z_i)}\le R\right\}.\]

    Assume that there exists an infinite open cover \(\mathcal{U}\) of \(X\) without finite subcovering. Bisect \(Q_0=Q\) into \(2^{2n}\) sub-cubes (for real and complex parts). Choose \(Q_1\) such that \(Q_1\cup X\) has no finite subcover of \(\mathcal{U}\). Under the previous assumptions, this is possible since if every \(\text{sub-cube}\cap X\) had finite subcovering, then \(Q_0\cap X=X\) would have finite subcovering. Similarly, choose \(Q_2\) by bisecting \(Q_1\) in a similar way, and recursively obtain a sequence of cubes:
    \[Q_0\supset Q_1\supset Q_2\supset\ldots\]
    Since the side length of each cube tends to 0, \(\bigcap_{i=0}^\infty Q_i\) consists of a single point \(z_{\infty}\in\mathbb{C}^n\). By the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem (\autoref{thm:bolzanoweierstrass}), because \(\forall i\in\mathbb{N}\), \(Q_i\cap X\neq\emptyset\), select a point \(z_{i}\in Q_i\cap X\), forming a sequence \({z_k}\in X\) convergent to \(z_\infty\in X\) as \(X\) is closed. Therefore, \(\exists U\in\mathcal{U}\) where \(z_\infty\in U\). Since \(U\) is open, \(\exists\varepsilon>0\) such that \(D(z_\infty,\varepsilon)\subset U\). \(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall k>N\), \(Q_k\subset D(z_\infty,\varepsilon)\). Then taking the intersection with \(X\) on both sides, \[Q_k\cap X\subseteq D(z_\infty,\varepsilon)\cap X\subset U.\] Our original assumption said that for every \(k\), \(Q_k\cap X\) has no finite subcovering. However, \(U\) covers \(Q_k\cap X\), which is a single open set that covers a nonempty subset. Therefore by contradiction, every open cover has finite subcovering.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}[Support of a Function]\label{def:support}
    For a set \(X\) and a function \(f:X\to\mathbb{C}\), the support, denoted as \(\supp(f)=\overline{\{z\in X\mid f(z)\neq 0\}}\), is the closure of the set for which \(f\) is non-zero.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    We are primarily concerned when the support of a function is compact, or if the support is bounded. For smooth functions, functions that are compactly supported are called bump functions.
\end{remark}
\subsection{Calculus}
Since complex analysis is essentially the theory of calculus on complex functions, it is only natural that generalizations are made on classical formulas in calculus for real functions.

It is well known that a function \(f:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}\) is differentiable at a point \(x\in(a,b)\) if the limit \[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\] exists, and the value of this limit is the derivative of \(f(x)\), denoted by \(f'(x)\) or \(\frac{\dd{f}}{\dd{x}}\). The value \(\dd{f}=f'(x)\dd{x}\) is the differential of \(f(x)\). Partition \([a,b]\) into \(a=x_0<x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_n=b\). Such that the length of the intervals \([x_i,x_{i-1}]\) tends to 0 as \(n\to\infty\). If for any such partition, the sum \[\sum_{i=1}^n f(\xi_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})\] tends to the same value \(\forall\xi_i\in[x_{i-1},x_i]\), then the function can be roughly said to be integrable over \([a,b]\). The full details of Riemann integrability relate to the upper and lower Riemann sums and will not be discussed here. The value of this sum is denoted by \[\int_a^bf(x)\dd{x}.\] The following theorems are the fundamental results of classical calculus:
\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Differential Form]
    Let \(f(x)\) be a function continuous over \([a,b]\). For \(x\in[a,b]\), define
    \[\Phi(x)=\int_a^xf(t)\dd{t}.\]
    Then \(\Phi(x)\) is differentiable over \([a,b]\), \(\Phi'(x)=f(x)\), and \(\dd{\Phi(x)}=f'(x)\dd{x}\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Integral Form]
    Let \(\Phi(x)\) be a function differentiable over \([a,b]\). Let \(f(x)=\Phi'(x)\) over \([a,b]\). Then,
    \[\int_a^xf(t)\dd{t}=\Phi(x)-\Phi(a).\]
\end{theorem}
The two forms of the theorem show that differentiation and integration are inverse operations to each other. Operations performed for differentiating oftentimes have a corresponding inverse operation that can be done for integrating. For instance, \[\dv{(f(x)\pm g(x))}{x}=\dv{f(x)}{x}\pm\dv{g(x)}{x}\] corresponds to \[\int(f(x)\pm g(x))\ddx=\int f(x)\ddx\pm\int g(x)\ddx,\]
and \[\dv{x}(f(x)g(x))=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)\] corresponds to \[\int f(x)g'(x)\ddx=f(x)g(x)-\int f'(x)g(x)\ddx,\] and \[\dv{f(g(x))}{x}=\dv{f(g)}{g}\cdot\dv{g(x)}{x}\] corresponds to \[\int_a^bf(g(x))g'(x)dx=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(u)du.\] Another correspondence is the Mean Value Theorem:
\begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem, Differential Form]
    If \(f(x)\) is differentiable over \([a,b]\), then \(\exists c\in[a,b]\) such that \[f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem, Integral Form]
    If \(f(x)\) is continuous over \([a,b]\), then \(\exists \xi\in[a,b]\) such that \[\int_a^bf(x)dx=f(\xi)(b-a).\]
\end{theorem}
A curve is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space. They can be parameterized with a vector \(\overrightarrow{F}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}
    P(t)\\Q(t)\\R(t)
\end{pmatrix}\) of one parameter. In the complex plane, a curve is a complex-valued function \(\gamma(t)\) for a real parameter \(\alpha\leq t\leq\beta\). A curve is \textit{closed} if \(\gamma(\alpha)=\gamma(\beta)\). It is \textit{smooth} if it is continuously differentiable, and its direction is defined to be the direction as \(t\) increases. If it is smooth everywhere except at a finite number of points, it is \textit{piecewise smooth}. If it is of finite length, then the curve is said to be \textit{rectifiable}. Piecewise smooth curves are rectifiable. A curve is \textit{simple} if it is simple (non self-intersecting), or if \(\gamma\paren{t_1}=\gamma\paren{t_2}\) implies that \(t_1=t_2\). A simple closed curve is also called a \textit{Jordan curve}.
\begin{theorem}[Jordan Curve Theorem]\label{thm:jordancurve}
    Let \(C\) be a Jordan curve in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Then the set \(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus C\) consists of exactly two connected subsets. One of them is the interior, and is a bounded region, while the other is the exterior, which is unbounded. Both of the two regions share the common boundary \(C\).
\end{theorem}
The theorem above seems trivial, but has a complicated rigorous proof in topology. The theorem can also be stated on \(\mathbb{C}\) instead of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). For a region \(U\), the boundary is denoted \(\partial U\). If the region bounded by any closed curve in \(U\) also lies in \(U\), then it is a \textit{simply connected} region. A connected region that is not simply connected is multiply connected. A region bound by 2 non-intersecting Jordan curves is two-connected, and a region bound by \(n\) non-intersecting Jordan curves is \(n\)-connected. Lastly, any closed curve can degenerate to a single point or slit.

Generalizations of the differential and integral exist for multivariate functions. The partial differentials of \(f(x,y,z)\), \(\pdv{f}{x}\ddx\), \(\pdv{f}{y}\ddy\), and \(\pdv{f}{z}\ddz\) sum up to form the total differential, denoted by \(\dd{f}\). Four main classical theorems exist, relating a function and its line integral in 2 and 3 dimensions, line and surface integrals in 2 and 3 dimensions, and the surface and volume integrals in 3 dimensions:
\begin{theorem}[Gradient Theorem]\label{thm:gradient}
    Let \(C\) be an oriented smooth curve in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with boundary points \(A\) to \(B\). Then
    \[\int_C\pdv{f}{x} \ddx+\pdv{f}{y}\ddy+\pdv{f}{z}\ddz=f(B)-f(A).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Green's Theorem]\label{thm:realgreen}
    Let \(R\) be a positively oriented, multiply connected region in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with a piecewise smooth oriented boundary \(\partial R\). For \(P(x,y),Q(x,y)\in C^1\paren{\overline{R}}\),
    \[\oint_{\partial R} P\ddx+Q\ddy=\iint_R\paren{\pdv{Q}{x}-\pdv{P}{y}}\ddx\ddy.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Stokes' Theorem]\label{thm:kelvinstokes}
    Let \(S\) be a positively oriented, smooth surface in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with a positively oriented boundary curve \(\partial S\). Let \(P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z)\in C^1\paren{\overline{S}}\). Then,
    \[\oint_{\partial S}P\ddx+Q\ddy+R\ddz = \iint_S\left(\pdv{R}{y}-\pdv{Q}{z}\right)\dd{y}\dd{z}+\left(\pdv{P}{z}-\pdv{R}{x}\right)\dd{z}\ddx+\left(\pdv{Q}{x}-\pdv{P}{y}\right)\ddx\ddy.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Gauss' Theorem]\label{thm:divergencegauss}
    Let \(V\) be a positively oriented region in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with a smooth, positively-oriented boundary surface \(\partial V\). Let \(P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z)\in C^1\paren{\overline{V}}\). Then,
    \[\oiint_{\partial V}P\ddy\ddz+Q\ddz\ddx+R\ddx\ddy=\iiint_V\left(\pdv{P}{x}+\pdv{Q}{y}+\pdv{R}{z}\right)\ddx\ddy\ddz.\]
\end{theorem}
In 3-dimensional \(\mathbb{R}^3\) space, define a scalar valued function to be a 0-form, a linear combination of \(\ddx\), \(\dd{y}\), and \(\dd{z}\) to be a 1-form, and a linear combination of \(\dd{y}\wedge\dd{z}\), \(\dd{z}\wedge\ddx\), and \(\dd{x}\wedge\dd{y}\) to be a 2-form, and \(\ddx\wedge\dd{y}\wedge\dd{z}\) to be a 3-form, where \(\wedge\) denotes an anti-commutative and associative product, where for any two differential forms \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\)
\[\omega_1\wedge\omega_2=-\omega_2\wedge\omega_1.\]
Then consequently, for any differential form \(\omega\), \[\omega\wedge\omega=0.\]
We can generalize the operator \(\dd\) to increase the degree of a differential form. For instance,
\[df=\pdv{f}{x}\ddx+\pdv{f}{y}\dd{y}+\pdv{f}{z}\dd{z},\]
which is the definition of the total differential. For a 1-form in 3-dimensional space, \(\omega_1=P\ddx+Q\dd{y}+R\dd{z}\), we can define the exterior derivative in a similar way: \begin{align*}
    \dd{\omega_1} & =\dd{P}\wedge\ddx+\dd{Q}\wedge\dd{y}+\dd{R}\wedge\dd{z}                                                                                                    \\
                  & =\left(\pdv{P}{x}\ddx+\pdv{P}{y}\dd{y}+\pdv{P}{z}\dd{z}\right)\wedge\ddx                                                                                   \\
                  & \qquad+\left(\pdv{Q}{x}\ddx+\pdv{Q}{y}\dd{y}+\pdv{Q}{z}\dd{z}\right)\wedge\ddy                                                                             \\
                  & \qquad\qquad+\left(\pdv{R}{x}\ddx+\pdv{R}{y}\dd{y}+\pdv{R}{z}\dd{z}\right)\wedge\dd{z}                                                                     \\
                  & =\left(\pdv{R}{y}-\pdv{Q}{z}\right)\dd{y}\wedge\dd{z}+\left(\pdv{P}{z}-\pdv{R}{x}\right)\dd{z}\wedge\ddx+\left(\pdv{Q}{x}-\pdv{P}{y}\right)\ddx\wedge\ddy.
\end{align*}
Similarly, we can differentiate a 2-form \(\omega=P\ddy\wedge\dd{z}+Q\ddz\wedge\ddx+R\ddx\wedge\ddy\) to get:
\[\left(\pdv{P}{x}+\pdv{Q}{y}+\pdv{R}{z}\right)\ddx\wedge\ddy\wedge\ddz.\]
The two results above resemble the curl and divergence of \(\begin{pmatrix}
    P \\Q\\R
\end{pmatrix}\).
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:poincare}
    For any differential form \(\omega\), the exterior derivative applied twice satisfies: \[\dd[2]{\omega}=\dd\dd\omega=0.\]
\end{lemma}
With the same analogy, the above result means that if \(\omega\) is a 0-form, then \(\nabla\times(\nabla\omega)=0\), and if \(\omega\) is a 1-form, \(\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times v)=0\), where \(v\) is the vector of the coefficients of the basis differential forms of \(\omega\) (there are no correlations for higher degree forms since in 3-dimensional space, the highest degree possible for any differential form is 3).

Then, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the Gradient Theorem, Green's, Stokes', and Gauss' Theorems can be generalized into:
\begin{theorem}[Stokes--Cartan Theorem]\label{thm:stokescartan}
    For an oriented smooth \(n\)-dimensional compact manifold \(M\) with boundary \(\partial M\), for a smooth differential \((n-1)\)-form \(\omega\) over \(\overline{M}\), \[\int_M\dd{\omega}=\int_{\partial M}\omega.\]
\end{theorem}
A portion of calculus is dedicated to rigorously defining concepts such as limits, continuity, integrability, etc. The most widely used definition of a finite limit of a function is the language of \(\varepsilon\)--\(\delta\), and states:
\begin{definition}[Epsilon-Delta]\label{def:epsilondelta}
    Let \(f:U\to\mathbb{R}\) be a function defined over an open set \(U\subseteq\mathbb{R}\) such that \(a\) is a limit point of \(U\). We say that \(\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L\) if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that for all \(x\in U\) with \(0<|x-a|<\delta\), we have \(|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon\).

    Similarly, we define the \textit{right-handed limit} \(\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=L\) if for every \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists \(\delta>0\) such that for all \(x\in U\) with \(0<x-a<\delta\), we have \(|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon\).

    Likewise, the \textit{left-hand limit} \(\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=L\) exists if for every \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists \(\delta>0\) such that for all \(x\in U\) with \(-\delta<x-a<0\), we have \(|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Continuity]\label{def:continuity}
    A function \(f:U \to \mathbb{R}\), defined on an open set \(U \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) containing a point \(a \in U\), is said to be continuous at \(a\) if \[\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a).\]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}
    Any continuous function on a compact set \(U\) is bounded on \(U\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(f:U\to\mathbb{R}\) is continuous and unbounded on compact \(U\). Then for each \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there exists \(x_n\in U\) such that \(|f(x_n)|>n\). The sequence \((x_n)\) lies in \(U\), which is compact, so by the Bolzano--Weierstrass Theorem (\autoref{thm:bolzanoweierstrass}), there exists a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) with \(x_{n_k}\to x^*\in U\).

    Since \(f\) is continuous, \(f(x_{n_k})\to f(x^*)\), so the sequence \((f(x_{n_k}))\) is bounded. But this contradicts \(|f(x_{n_k})|>n_k\to\infty\), hence \(f\) must be bounded on \(U\).
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Extreme Value Theorem]\label{thm:extremevalue}
    A continuous function \(f(x)\) over a compact set \(U\) attains its infimum and supremum in \(U\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Assume that \(U\) never attains its supremum \(M\). Then, \(f(x)<M\). Define \(\psi(x)=\frac{1}{M-f(x)}\), which is strictly positive and continuous as the denominator never reaches 0. By \autoref{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}, \(\psi(x)\) is bounded with some value of \(\mu>0\) satisfying \(\psi(x)\leq\mu\). \(f(x)\) also has the representation \(M-\frac{1}{\psi(x)}\), and therefore, \[f(x)\leq M-\frac{1}{\mu},\] which means that \(M\) is not the supremum. Similarly, assume that \(U\) never attains its infimum \(m\). Then \(f(x)>m\). Let \(\psi(x)=\frac{1}{f(x)-m}\), which is strictly positive and continuous as the denominator never reaches 0. By \autoref{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}, \(\psi(x)\) is bounded with some value of \(\mu>0\) satisfying \(\psi(x)\leq\mu\). \(f(x)\) also has the representation \(m+\frac{1}{\psi(x)}\), and therefore, \[f(x)\geq m+\frac{1}{\mu},\] which means that \(m\) is not the infimum.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}[Uniform Continuity]\label{def:uniformcontinuity}
    A function \(f:U\to\mathbb{R}\), defined on a set \(U\subseteq\mathbb{R}\), is uniformly continuous if and only if \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), \(\exists\delta>0\) such that \(\forall x,y\in U\) where \(|x-y|<\delta\), \(\abs{f(x)-f(y)}<\varepsilon\).
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    The function \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\) is not uniformly continuous over \((0,1)\).
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    If \(\exists\varepsilon>0\) such that \(\forall\delta>0\), \(\exists x,y\in(0,1)\) such that \(|x-y|<\delta\) and \(\abs{f(x)-f(y)}\geq\varepsilon\), then \(f(x)\) is not uniformly continuous over \((0,1)\).

    Let \(\varepsilon=1\) and \[x=\frac{1}{n},\quad y=\frac{1}{n+1}.\] Then \(\forall\delta>0\), \(\exists n>1\) where \(\abs{x-y}<\delta\), since \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|x-y\right|=0\). Additionally, \(\abs{f(x)-f(y)}=1\geq\varepsilon\). This satisfies the negation, and thus, \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\) is not uniformly continuous over \((0,1)\).
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:uniformcontinuousovercompactset}
    A continuous function over a compact set \(U\) is uniformly continuous over \(U\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose for contradiction that \(f:U\to\mathbb{R}\) is continuous but not uniformly continuous on compact \(U\). Then \(\exists\varepsilon_0>0\) such that \(\forall\delta>0\), \(\exists x,y\in U\) with \(|x-y|<\delta\) and \(|f(x)-f(y)|\geq\varepsilon_0\).

    In particular, \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), let \(\delta=\frac{1}{n}\). Then \(\exists x_n,y_n\in U\) such that \(|x_n-y_n|<\frac{1}{n}\) and \(|f(x_n)-f(y_n)|\geq\varepsilon_0\). Since \(U\) is compact, the sequence \((x_n)\) has a convergent subsequence \(x_{n_k}\to x_{\infty}\in U\). Because \(|x_{n_k}-y_{n_k}|<\frac{1}{n_k}\to 0\), we also have \(y_{n_k}\to x_{\infty}\).

    By continuity of \(f\), \(f(x_{n_k})\to f\paren{x_\infty}\) and \(f(y_{n_k})\to f\paren{x_\infty}\), so \(|f(x_{n_k})-f(y_{n_k})|\to 0\), contradicting \(|f(x_{n_k})-f(y_{n_k})|\geq\varepsilon_0\). Therefore, \(f\) is uniformly continuous on \(U\).
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    A function \(f\) is Lipschitz continuous over \(U\) if \(\exists C\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\) such that \(\forall x,y \in U\), \(|f(x)-f(y)| \leq C|x-y|\).
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:c1lipschitz}
    A \(C^1\) function on a compact set \(U\) is Lipschitz continuous on \(U\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(f:U\to\mathbb{R}\) be \(C^1\). By \autoref{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}, since \(U\) is compact and \(f'\) is continuous, \(\exists M>0\) such that \(\forall x\in U\), \(|f'(x)|\leq M\).

    By the Mean Value Theorem, \(\forall x,y\in U\), \(\exists c\) between \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(f(x)-f(y)=f'(c)(x-y)\). Then, \(|f(x)-f(y)|=|f'(c)||x-y|\leq M|x-y|\), which means \(f\) is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant \(M\).
\end{proof}
\section{Complex Prerequisites}
\subsection{The Complex Plane}
All complex numbers form a field that extends the real number field. A complex number \(\alpha+i\beta\) can be visualized on a rectangular plane as the point \((\alpha,\beta)\), with two axes: the real axis and the imaginary axis. It is well known that any complex number also has the polar form \(re^{i\theta}=r\paren{\cos\theta+i\sin\theta}\).

The infinity point, \(\infty\), extends \(\mathbb{C}\) with \(\riemannsphere=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}\). \(\forall a\in\mathbb{C}\), \(a+\infty=\infty+a=\infty\). \(\forall b\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\), \(b\cdot\infty=\infty\cdot b=\infty\) and \(\frac{b}{\infty}=0\).

Let \(S^2=\left\{\paren{x_1,x_2,x_3}\in\mathbb{R}\,\middle|\,x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1\right\}\). There exists a \textit{stereographic projection} of \(S^2\) onto \(\riemannsphere\). For every point other than \((0,0,1)\), there is a corresponding complex number \[z=\frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3}.\]
This correspondence between \(\mathbb{C}\) and \(S^2\setminus\left\{(0,0,1)\right\}\) is injective. In fact, the inverse can be solved for:
\[\abs{z}^2=\frac{1-x_3^2}{\paren{1-x_3}^2}=\frac{1+x_3}{1-x_3},\]
which results in \[x_3=\frac{\abs{z}^2-1}{\abs{z}^2+1},\]
and consequently,
\[x_1=\real\paren{z}\paren{1-x_3}=\frac{z+\overline{z}}{\abs{z}^2+1},\quad x_2=\imaginary\paren{z}\paren{1-x_3}=\frac{z-\overline{z}}{i\abs{z}^2+i}.\]
By letting \(\infty\) correspond to \(\paren{0,0,1}\), the bijection is complete. The sphere \(S^2\) is also called the \textit{Riemann sphere}. The region given by the disk \(\abs{z}<1\) is given by \(x_3<0\), and the region \(\abs{z}>1\) is given by \(x_3>0\). In this representation, \(\infty\in\riemannsphere\) is no longer considered special.
\subsection{Complex Differentiation}
For \(U\subseteq \mathbb{C}\) and a complex function \(f:\mathbb{U}\to\mathbb{C}\), \(f(z)\) is complex differentiable at \(z\in U\) if the following limit exists, regardless of the direction \(h\) approaches 0 at:
\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}.\]
We can consider \(f(z)\) to be a bivariate function \(f(x,y)\) for \(z=x+iy\). Two main cases we are concerned with are when \(h\) approaches 0 from the real and imaginary axes:
\[\lim_{\substack{h\to0\\h\in\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}=\lim_{\substack{h\to0\\h\in\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(z+ih)-f(z)}{ih}.\] Expressing \(f(z)\) as \(f(x,y)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)\),
\[\lim_{\substack{h\to0\\h\in\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}=\lim_{\substack{h\to0\\h\in\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}=\pdv{u}{x}+i\pdv{v}{x},\]
\[\lim_{\substack{h\to0\\h\in\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(z+ih)-f(z)}{ih}=-i\lim_{\substack{h\to0\\h\in\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}=\pdv{v}{y}-i\pdv{u}{y}.\]
By comparing the real and imaginary parts, we obtain necessary conditions for complex differentiability:
\begin{equation}
    \pdv{u}{x}=\pdv{v}{y}\quad\text{and}\quad\pdv{v}{x}=-\pdv{u}{y}\label{eq:cauchyriemanneqs1}
\end{equation}
By multiplying the second equation by \(i\) and adding it to the first, we obtain the logical equivalence with:
\begin{equation}
    \pdv{f}{x}=-i\pdv{f}{y}\label{eq:cauchyriemanneqs2}
\end{equation}
Equations \eqref{eq:cauchyriemanneqs1} and \eqref{eq:cauchyriemanneqs2} are known as the \textit{Cauchy--Riemann equations}. Although this condition is necessary, it is not sufficient. Consider the function \(f(z)=\sqrt{\left|\real(z)\imaginary(z)\right|}\). Let \(z=x+yi\), \(x=\alpha t\), and \(y=\beta t\). Then
\[\lim_{z\to0}\frac{f(z)-f(0)}{z-0}=\lim_{z\to0}\frac{f(z)}{z}=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sqrt{\left|\alpha\beta t^2\right|}}{\alpha t+i\beta t}=\frac{\sqrt{\left|\alpha\beta\right|}}{\alpha+i\beta}.\]
The derivative along \(\alpha=1\), \(\beta=0\) (or the real axis) vanishes. Along \(\alpha=0\), \(\beta=1\) (or the imaginary axis), it also vanishes. However, the limit is different for any other pair of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), or the consequent direction of approach.

If a function \(f(z)\) is complex differentiable over an open neighborhood of \(z_0\), then \(f(z)\) is \textit{holomorphic} at \(z_0\). If \(f(z)\) is holomorphic for every point in an open set \(U\), then it is said to be holomorphic over \(U\). A function is \textit{entire} if it is holomorphic over \(\mathbb{C}\).
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:holomorphycondition}
    The necessary and sufficient criterion for a function \(f(z)\) to be holomorphic on a region \(D\) is if \(f(z)\in C^1(D)\) and it satisfies the Cauchy--Riemann equations.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The first part is to prove that any holomorphic function over \(D\) has continuous first-order partial derivatives over \(D\). This requires an argument that will be covered later (specifically in \autoref{sec:analyticityandholomorphy}), which claims that the complex derivative of any holomorphic function is also holomorphic over the region.

    For the second part, let \(f(z)=f(x,y)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)\). Assume that \(u,v\in C^1\paren{\{z_0\}}\) and satisfy the Cauchy--Riemann equations at \(z_0=x_0+iy_0\). Let \[\alpha=\pdv{u}{x}\paren{x_0,y_0}=\pdv{v}{y}\paren{x_0,y_0},\quad\beta=\pdv{v}{x}\paren{x_0,y_0}=-\pdv{u}{y}\paren{x_0,y_0}.\]

    Then because \(u,v\in C^1\paren{D}\) have continuous partial derivatives, \(\forall x,y\in D\):
    \[u\paren{x,y}-u\paren{x_0,y_0}=\alpha\paren{x-x_0}-\beta\paren{y-y_0}+o_1\paren{\abs{\Delta z}},\]
    \[v\paren{x,y}-v\paren{x_0,y_0}=\beta\paren{x-x_0}+\alpha\paren{y-y_0}+o_2\paren{\abs{\Delta z}},\]
    where \(\abs{\Delta z}=\sqrt{{\Delta x}^2+{\Delta y}^2}\) and \(o_1\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}\) and \(o_2\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}\) are functions that are of higher infinitesimal order to \(\Delta z\), satisfying \(\lim_{\Delta z\to0}\frac{o_1\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}}{\abs{\Delta z}}=0\) and \(\lim_{\Delta z\to0}\frac{o_2\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}}{\abs{\Delta z}}=0\). Then letting \(\Delta z=x-x_0+i\paren{y-y_0}\),
    \[f\paren{z}-f\paren{z_0}=\alpha{\Delta z}+i\beta{\Delta z}+o_1\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}+o_2\paren{\abs{\Delta z}},\]
    \[\frac{f\paren{z}-f\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}=\alpha+i\beta+\frac{o_1\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}}{\abs{\Delta z}}\frac{\abs{\Delta z}}{\Delta z}+\frac{o_2\paren{\abs{\Delta z}}}{\abs{\Delta z}}\frac{\abs{\Delta z}}{\Delta z}.\]
    Taking the limit as \(\Delta z\to0\), the infinitesimal terms on the right vanish, and \[\lim_{\Delta z\to0}\frac{f\paren{z}-f\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}=\alpha+i\beta.\]
\end{proof}
An extension that is much harder to prove gives a subtle result:
\begin{theorem}[Looman--Menchoff Theorem]\label{thm:loomanmenchoff}
    A function \(f(z)\) is holomorphic over an open set \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) if and only if it is continuous on \(U\), differentiable on \(U\setminus N\) for some set \(N\) with measure zero, and satisfies the \textit{Cauchy–Riemann equations}.
\end{theorem}
Clearly, any function satisfying the criteria in \autoref{thm:holomorphycondition} will also satisfy the criteria for the Looman--Menchoff Theorem (\autoref{thm:loomanmenchoff}). However, the first theorem is a logical equivalence for holomorphy. This implies that any holomorphic function over \(U\) with existent partial derivatives except for on a set with measure zero has the property that those partial derivatives are automatically continuous.

We will prove later in \autoref{sec:analyticityandholomorphy} that the complex derivative of a holomorphic function \(f(z)=u(z)+iv(z)\) is holomorphic. Under this assumption, \(f(z)\) has continuous second order partial derivatives, and therefore, \[\pdv[2]{u}{x}{y}=\pdv[2]{u}{y}{x},\quad\pdv[2]{v}{x}{y}=\pdv[2]{v}{y}{x},\] and by the Cauchy--Riemann equations, \[\pdv[2]{u}{x}=\pdv[2]{v}{x}{y},\quad\pdv[2]{u}{y}=-\pdv[2]{v}{y}{x},\]
and \[\pdv[2]{v}{x}=-\pdv[2]{u}{x}{y},\quad\pdv[2]{v}{y}=\pdv[2]{u}{y}{x}.\]
Adding the equations, \[\pdv[2]{u}{x}+\pdv[2]{u}{y}=0,\quad\pdv[2]{v}{x}+\pdv[2]{v}{y}=0.\]
This type of equation is called the \textit{Laplace equation}, which is a basic example of an elliptic partial differential equation. Define the operator (the \textit{Laplacian}) \[\Delta=\nabla^2=\pdv[2]{}{x}+\pdv[2]{}{y}.\] A function \(u\) satisfying the Laplace equation \(\Delta u=0\) is a \textit{harmonic function}. Thus, the real and complex parts of a holomorphic function are harmonic functions.
\subsubsection{Wirtinger Derivatives}
We have previously introduced the concept of expressing a complex function as a function of \(x\) and \(y\). It can also be expressed in terms of \(z\) and \(\overline{z}\), where \(z=x+iy\) and \(\overline{z}=x-iy\). Then \(|z|=z\overline{z}\), \(x=\frac{z+\overline{z}}{2}\), and \(y=\frac{z-\overline{z}}{2i}\). By the rules of the derivative, \begin{equation}
    \pdv{}{z}=\pdv{}{x}\pdv{x}{z}+\pdv{}{y}\pdv{y}{z}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\pdv{}{x}-i\pdv{}{y}\right)\label{eq:wirtingerderivative1}
\end{equation} and \begin{equation}
    \pdv{}{\overline{z}}=\pdv{}{x}\pdv{x}{\overline{z}}+\pdv{}{y}\pdv{y}{\overline{z}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\pdv{}{x}+i\pdv{}{y}\right).\label{eq:wirtingerderivative2}
\end{equation}
If equation \eqref{eq:wirtingerderivative1} is set equal to 0, then it is the equivalent form of the homogeneous Cauchy--Riemann Equations. Then for a holomorphic function \(f(z)\), the Wirtinger derivative \(\pdv{f(z)}{z}=\dv{f(z)}{z}\).

Conversely, by the rules of the derivative, \begin{equation*}
    \pdv{}{x}=\pdv{}{z}\pdv{z}{x}+\pdv{}{\overline{z}}\pdv{\overline{z}}{x}=\pdv{}{z}+\pdv{}{\overline{z}}
\end{equation*} and \begin{equation*}
    \pdv{}{y}=\pdv{}{z}\pdv{z}{y}+\pdv{}{\overline{z}}\pdv{\overline{z}}{y}=i\pdv{}{z}-i\pdv{}{\overline{z}}.
\end{equation*}

The Laplacian is equal to \begin{align*}
    \Delta=\pdv[2]{}{x}+\pdv[2]{}{y} & =\paren{\pdv{}{z}+\pdv{}{\overline{z}}}^2+\paren{i\pdv{}{z}-i\pdv{}{\overline{z}}}^2                                               \\
                                     & =\pdv[2]{}{z}+\pdv[2]{}{\overline{z}}+2\pdv[2]{}{z}{\overline{z}}-\pdv[2]{}{z}-\pdv[2]{}{\overline{z}}+2\pdv[2]{}{z}{\overline{z}} \\
                                     & =4\pdv[2]{}{z}{\overline{z}}.
\end{align*}
\subsection{Complex Power Series}
Power series in real analysis can be generalized into complex series. Particularly, concepts such as uniform convergence are the same in complex series:
\begin{definition}[Uniform Convergence]
    For a set \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\), a function sequence \(\paren{f_n(z)}\) uniformly converges to a function \(f(z)\) if and only if \(\forall\varepsilon>0\),\(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall n>N\), \(\forall z\in U\), \(\abs{f(z)-f_n(z)}<\varepsilon\).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy Criterion]\label{thm:cauchycriterionuniformconvergence}
    For a set \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\), a function sequence \(\paren{f_n(z)}\) uniformly converges to a function \(f(z)\) if and only if \(\forall\varepsilon>0\),\(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall n,m>N\), \(\forall z\in U\), \(\abs{f_n(z)-f_m(z)}<\varepsilon\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), \(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall n,m>N\), \(\forall z\in U\), \[\abs{f_m(z)-f(z)}<\frac{\varepsilon}{2},\quad\abs{f_n(z)-f(z)}<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}.\]
    Then,
    \[\abs{f_m(z)-f_n(z)}\leq\abs{f_n(z)-f(z)}+\abs{f_m(z)-f(z)}<\varepsilon.\]
\end{proof}
Function series are defined to be a sequence formed by the partial sums of function sequences. There are many ways to verify the uniform convergence of a function series. Perhaps the most widely known is the Weierstrass \(M\)--Test. 
\begin{theorem}[Weierstrass \(M\)--Test]\label{thm:weierstrassmtest}
    For a set \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\), if a function series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty{f_n(z)}\) is uniformly bounded (bounded termwise \(\forall z\)) by a convergent series independent of \(z\), then \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty{f_n(z)}\) uniformly converges.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n\) be a convergent series that uniformly bounds each term of \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(z)\). By the convergence of \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n\), \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), \(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall m\geq n>N\), \[\abs{M_m+M_{m-1}+\cdots+M_{n+1}}<\varepsilon.\] Since \(M_j\) bounds \(f_j(z)\), it follows that \[\abs{f_m(z)+f_{m-1}(z)+\cdots+f_{n+1}(z)}\leq\abs{M_m+M_{m-1}+\cdots+M_{n+1}}<\varepsilon,\]
    and the result follows from \autoref{thm:cauchycriterionuniformconvergence}.
\end{proof}
The concept of uniform convergence is generalized to improper integrals with parameters, and the same theorems from series have a corresponding counterpart.

In both complex and real analysis, the concept of \textit{power series}, a unique type of function series, is of trivial importance. Similar to real power series, complex series have the form \[\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n,\] where \(\paren{a_n}\) are constants.

We will now observe the convergence of power series.
\begin{theorem}[Abel's Theorem]
    For a power series \(S(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n\), there exists a constant \(R\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\cup\cbraces{\infty}\), known as the \textit{radius of convergence} such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(S(z)\) absolutely converges on \(\abs{z}<R\), and \(\forall 0\leq\rho<R\), uniformly converges on \(\abs{z}\leq\rho\).
        \item \(S(z)\) diverges on \(\abs{z}>R\).
        \item \(S(z)\) is holomorphic over \(\abs{z}<R\) and \(S'(z)\) can be obtained by termwise differentiation \(S'(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty na_nz^{n-1}\) and also has the radius of convergence \(R\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
The disk \(\abs{z}<R\) is known as the \textit{disk of convergence}, a direct generalization of the \textit{interval of convergence} for real series. There are many ways to determine the radius of convergence:
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy--Hadamard Theorem]\label{cauchyhadamard}
    The radius of convergence of the power series in the form of \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n\) can be determined by \[\frac{1}{\limsup_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{\abs{a_n}}}.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    First assume that \(\abs{z}<\frac{1}{\limsup_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{\abs{a_n}}}\)
\end{proof}
Of course, a convergence radius of \(0\) implies that the series is divergent everywhere except for possibly at \(0\), and a convergence radius of \(\infty\) means that the series absolutely converges everywhere. 
\subsection{Elementary Functions}

\section{Complex Integration}
It is important to know the differential 2-forms even for a single variable complex function. Consider \(z=x+iy\) and \(\overline{z}=x-iy\). We can then write their corresponding differentials:
\[\ddz=\ddx+i\ddy,\quad\dd{\overline{z}}=\ddx-i\ddy.\]
The antisymmetric properties of differential forms still hold in complex space. By taking the wedge product of the two basis complex differential forms, we get \begin{align*}
    \dd{\overline{z}}\wedge\ddz & =\paren{\ddx-i\ddy}\wedge\paren{\ddx+i\ddy} \\
                                & =2i\ddx\wedge\ddy.
\end{align*}
Analogous to the real case, a 0-form is defined as a scalar-valued function in the form \(f\paren{z,\overline{z}}\), a 1-form in the form of \(\omega_0\ddz+\omega_1\dd{\overline{z}}\), and a 2-form as \(\omega_0\ddz\wedge\dd{\overline{z}}\). The exterior differential operator for this one-dimensional case is defined as \(\partial+\overline{\partial}\), where \(\partial=\ddz\wedge\pdv{}{z}\) and \(\overline{\partial}=\dd{\overline{z}}\wedge\pdv{}{\overline{z}}\). Occasionally, people will informally use \(\partial\) and \(\overline{\partial}\) as an abbreviation for \(\pdv{}{z}\) and \(\pdv{}{\overline{z}}\) respectively.
\begin{theorem}[Green's Theorem, Complex Form]\label{thm:complexgreen}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be bounded with a piecewise smooth boundary \(\partial U\). For two scalar functions \(\omega_1=\omega_1\paren{z,\overline{z}}\) and \(\omega_2=\omega_2\paren{z,\overline{z}}\) satisfying \(\omega_1,\omega_2\in C^1\paren{\overline{U}}\), define the 1-form \(\omega=\omega_1\ddz+\omega_2\dd{\overline{z}}\). Then,
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{\partial U}\omega=\int_U\dd{\omega}.\label{eq:complexgreen}
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For real-valued functions \(\xi_1,\xi_2,\eta_1,\eta_2\), let \[\omega_1=\xi_1+i\eta_1,\quad\omega_2=\xi_2+i\eta_2.\]
    Then,
    \begin{align}
        \omega & =\paren{\xi_1+i\eta_1}\ddz+\paren{\xi_2+i\eta_2}\dd{\overline{z}}\label{eq:complexgreen_omegaexpansionintermediate}                                                               \\
               & =\paren{\xi_1+i\eta_1}\paren{\ddx+i\ddy}+\paren{\xi_2+i\eta_2}\paren{\ddx-i\ddy}\nonumber                                                                                         \\
               & =\xi_1\ddx+i\eta_1\ddx+i\xi_1\ddy-\eta_1\ddy+\xi_2\ddx+i\eta_2\ddx-i\xi_2\ddy+\eta_2\ddy\nonumber                                                                                 \\
               & =\brackets{\paren{\xi_1+\xi_2}\ddx+\paren{\eta_2-\eta_1}\ddy}+i\brackets{\paren{\eta_1+\eta_2}\ddx+\paren{\xi_1-\xi_2}\ddy}\label{eq:complexgreen_realandcomplexdxdyintermediate}
    \end{align}
    Each of \(\xi_1,\xi_2,\eta_1,\eta_2\) are real-valued functions that can be represented with a domain of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). We then will apply the \(d=\partial+\overline{\partial}\) definition of the exterior derivative and relate it to \eqref{eq:complexgreen}. Starting with equation \eqref{eq:complexgreen_omegaexpansionintermediate}, \begin{align}

    \end{align}
    From equation \eqref{eq:complexgreen_realandcomplexdxdyintermediate}, we can apply \autoref{thm:realgreen}. For the real component of \(\omega\), we obtain
    \[\int_{\partial U} \paren{\xi_1+\xi_2}\ddx+\paren{\eta_2-\eta_1}\ddy=\iint_U\paren{\pdv{\eta_2}{x}-\pdv{\xi_1}{y}-\pdv{\eta_1}{x}-\pdv{\xi_2}{y}}\ddx\ddy,\]
    and for the imaginary component,
    \[\int_{\partial U}\paren{\eta_1+\eta_2}\ddx+\paren{\xi_1-\xi_2}\ddy=\iint_U\paren{\pdv{\xi_1}{x}-\pdv{\eta_1}{y}-\pdv{\xi_2}{x}-\pdv{\eta_2}{y}}\ddx\ddy,\]
    and the integrands on the right side both match those of equation \eqref{eq:complexgreen_exteriorderivativeresult}.
\end{proof}
The theorem above is only a specific case of the Stokes-Cartan Theorem (\autoref{thm:stokescartan}). However, it proves the validity of the treatment of the \(\partial\) and \(\overline{\partial}\) operators, and the generalization to forms with basis \(\ddz\) and \(\dd{\overline{z}}\).
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy--Pompeiu Theorem]\label{thm:pompeiu}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be bounded with a piecewise smooth boundary \(\partial U\). Let \(f(z)\in C^1(\overline{U})\). Then \(\forall z\in U\setminus\partial U\), \begin{equation}
        f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\left(\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\mathop{\dd{\zeta}}-\int_{U}\pdv{f(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}\right).
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(z\in U\setminus\partial U\), \(\exists\varepsilon>0\) such that \(D(z,\varepsilon)\subset U\). Consider the complex differential form \[\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}\]
    with a singularity at \(\zeta=z\). Consider the region \(U\setminus D(z,\varepsilon)\). Since \(f\in C^1\paren{\overline{U}}\), by applying Green's Theorem (\autoref{thm:complexgreen}), \begin{equation}
        \int_{U\setminus D(z,\varepsilon)}\dd(\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z})=\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}-\int_{\partial D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}.\label{eq:pompeiu_directintermediate}
    \end{equation}
    By properties of \(\dd\), the expression is equal to \[\int_{U\setminus D(z,\varepsilon)}\left(\partial+\overline{\partial}\right)\left(\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\right)\wedge\ddzeta=\int_{U\setminus D(z,\varepsilon)}\pdv{}{\zeta}\left(\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\right)\ddzeta\wedge\ddzeta+\pdv{}{\overline{\zeta}}\left(\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\right)\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta.\]
    The first term in the integrand vanishes as it contains \(\ddzeta\wedge\ddzeta\). The second term can be simplified using the fact that \(\pdv{\overline{\zeta}}(\frac{1}{\zeta-z})=0\), leading to
    \[\int_{U\setminus D(z,\varepsilon)}\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}.\]
    The rightmost term in equation \eqref{eq:pompeiu_directintermediate} can be parameterized with \(\zeta=z+\varepsilon e^{it}\), \(t\in[0,2\pi)\). Then, \begin{gather*}
        \int_{\partial D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}=\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}}{\varepsilon e^{it}}\cdot i\varepsilon e^{it}\dd{t}=i\int_0^{2\pi}f(z+\varepsilon e^{it})\dd{t}\\
        =i\int_0^{2\pi}\left(f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)\right)\dd{t}+i\int_0^{2\pi}f(z)\dd{t}
    \end{gather*} Because \(f\in C^1\left(\overline{U}\right)\), by \autoref{lemma:c1lipschitz}, \(\exists M\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\) such that \(\forall z_0,z_1\in\overline{U}\), \(\abs{f\paren{z_1}-f\paren{z_0}}\le M\abs{z_1-z_0}\). In particular, \(\abs{f(z+\varepsilon e^{it})-f(z)}\leq M\varepsilon\). Therefore, \[\abs{\int_0^{2\pi}\left(f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)\right)\dd{t}}\leq\int_0^{2\pi}\abs{f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)}\dd{t}\leq 2M\pi\varepsilon,\] which approaches 0 as \(\varepsilon\to0\). Taking this limit, we obtain \begin{equation}
        2\pi if(z)=\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}-\int_{U}\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}+\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}. \label{eq:pompeiu_epsilonlimitintermediate}
    \end{equation}
    We then aim to prove that \begin{equation}
        \lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}=0.\label{eq:pompeiu_areadiskstatement}
    \end{equation}
    Notice that since \(f\in C^1\paren{\overline{U}}\), by \autoref{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}, \(\exists M'\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\) such that \(\forall\zeta\in\overline{U}\), \(\abs{\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}}\leq M'\). Then,
    \[\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\abs{\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}}\leq M'\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\abs{\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{1}{\zeta-z}\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}.\]
    By a change of variables to a polar coordinate system centered around \(z\), we obtain
    \[M'\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\abs{\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{1}{re^{i\theta}}\dd{\paren{z+re^{-i\theta}}}\wedge\dd{\paren{z+re^{i\theta}}}},\] and by expansion of the wedge product,
    \begin{align}
        M'\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\abs{\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{2i}{e^{i\theta}}\dd{r}\wedge\dd{\theta}} & =2M'\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\abs{\int_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{1}{e^{i\theta}}\dd{r}\wedge\dd{\theta}}\label{eq:pompeiu_weaksingularityvanishes} \\
                                                                                                           & =2M'\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\abs{\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\varepsilon e^{-i\theta}\dd{r}\dd{\theta}}\nonumber                                        \\
                                                                                                           & =0.\nonumber
    \end{align}
    Then from rearranging \eqref{eq:pompeiu_epsilonlimitintermediate}, we obtain:
    \[f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\paren{\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}-\int_{U}\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}}.\]
\end{proof}
In complex analysis, when integrating over a region that contains a singularity, it is common to exclude a small disk of radius \(\varepsilon\) around the singularity, perform the integration over the punctured region, and then take the limit as \(\varepsilon\to0\). As in the proof above, the steps calculating the integral over the removed disk as in equation \eqref{eq:pompeiu_areadiskstatement} are still necessary in confirmation, although they are typically implicitly elided.

From the above result, we can directly obtain the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Integral Formula]\label{thm:cauchyintegralformula}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be an open region bounded with a \(C^1\) boundary \(\partial U \), and let \(f\in C^1(\overline{U})\) be holomorphic on \(U\). Then for all \(z\in U\),
    \begin{equation}
        f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\dd{\zeta}.\label{eq:cauchyintegralformula}
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By equation \eqref{eq:wirtingerderivative2}, for \(f\paren{\zeta,\overline{\zeta}}\), \(\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}=0\). Applying the Cauchy--Pompeiu Theorem (\autoref{thm:pompeiu}), the area integral vanishes, and equation \eqref{eq:cauchyintegralformula} consequently follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Integral Theorem]\label{thm:cauchyintegraltheorem}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be an open region bounded with a \(C^1\) boundary \(\partial U\). For a function \(f(z)\in C^1\paren{\overline{U}}\) holomorphic over \(U\), \[\oint_{\partial U}f(\zeta)\ddzeta=0.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(\psi(z)=zf(z)\). Applying \autoref{thm:cauchyintegralformula} on \(\psi(\zeta)\) with \(z=0\), we obtain \[0=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta}\ddzeta=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint f\paren{\zeta}\ddzeta.\]
    Alternatively, we can use Green's Theorem (\autoref{thm:complexgreen}) with \(\omega=f(\zeta)\ddzeta\):
    \[\int_{\partial U}f(\zeta)\ddzeta=\int_{U}\dd{\omega}=\int_U\pdv{f}{\overline{\zeta}}\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta=0.\]
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution}
    For a compactly supported function \(\psi(z)\in C^1\paren{\mathbb{C}}\), a solution satisfying \(u(z)\in C^1\paren{\mathbb{C}}\) to the non-homogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equation \[\pdv{u(z)}{\overline{z}}=\psi(z)\] is \begin{equation}
        u(z)=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta.\label{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution}
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We aim to prove the theorem in three parts: the continuity of \(u(z)\), the continuous differentiability of \(u(z)\), and the fact that it satisfies the differential equation \(\pdv{u(z)}{\overline{z}}=\psi(z)\).

    Split \(\mathbb{C}\) into \(\mathbb{C}\setminus D\paren{z,\varepsilon}\) and \(D\paren{z,\varepsilon}\). \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), the integral \[-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}\setminus D\paren{z,\varepsilon}}\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta\] is continuous. Since \(\psi(\zeta)\) is compactly supported over \(\mathbb{C}\) and continuous, by \autoref{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}, it is bounded. Then the limit \[\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\paren{-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{D\paren{z,\varepsilon}}\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}=0.\] Therefore, \eqref{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution} is continuous. Let \(\xi=\zeta-z\) and observe that \[u(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{\psi(\xi+z)}{\xi}\dd{\xi}\wedge\dd{\overline{\xi}}\] Then, \begin{equation}
        \frac{u(z+h)-u\paren{z}}{h}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{\psi(\xi+z+h)-\psi\paren{\xi+z}}{h\xi}\dd{\xi}\wedge\dd{\overline{\xi}}.\label{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr}
    \end{equation}
    For a fixed \(z\), the value of \[\frac{\psi(\xi+z+h)-\psi\paren{\xi+z}}{h}\] tends to \(\pdv{\psi}{\zeta}\paren{\xi+z}\) as \(h\to0\). Because \(\psi(\zeta)=\psi\paren{\xi+z}\) has compact support and is \(C^1\), by \autoref{lemma:c1lipschitz}, it is Lipschitz continuous for a constant \(M\). Then, \[\abs{\frac{\psi(\xi+z+h)-\psi\paren{\xi+z}}{h}}\leq M,\] and when \(\xi+z\notin\supp(\psi)\), \[\frac{\psi(\xi+z+h)-\psi\paren{\xi+z}}{h}=0.\]
    Since the integrand is dominated by a function that has a convergent integral (\(\int_{\supp(\psi)}M\dd{\xi}\wedge\dd{\overline{\xi}}\)), equation \eqref{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr} uniformly converges and the limit \(h\to0\) may commute with the integral. Let \(\zeta=\alpha+i\beta\). From the real axis, \begin{equation}
        \pdv{u}{x}(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{1}{\xi}\pdv{\psi}{\alpha}\paren{\xi+z}\dd{\xi}\wedge\dd{\overline{\xi}}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\pdv{\psi(\zeta)}{\alpha}\cdot\frac{1}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}.\label{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr_realaxisderivative}
    \end{equation}
    From the imaginary axis, \begin{equation}
        \pdv{u}{y}(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{1}{\xi}\pdv{\psi}{\beta}\paren{\xi+z}\dd{\xi}\wedge\dd{\overline{\xi}}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\pdv{\psi(\zeta)}{\beta}\cdot\frac{1}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}.\label{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr_imaginaryaxisderivative}
    \end{equation}
    Since \(\psi\in C^1\paren{\mathbb{C}}\) and has Lipschitz constant \(M\), equations \eqref{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr_realaxisderivative} and \eqref{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr_imaginaryaxisderivative} are both continuous (by the same argument for the continuity of \(u(z)\)). Hence, \(u\in C^1(\mathbb{C})\). It follows from the two equations that \[\pdv{u}{\overline{z}}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\pdv{\psi}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{1}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\supp(\psi)}\pdv{\psi}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{1}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}.\] Over the bounded domain \(\supp\paren{\psi}\), and by the Cauchy--Pompeiu Theorem (\autoref{thm:pompeiu}), the integral above is equal to \[\pdv{u}{\overline{z}}=\psi(z)-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial\supp(\psi)}\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta.\]
    Since \(\psi\) is continuous and compactly supported, it vanishes on \(\partial\supp\paren{\psi}\): \[\pdv{u}{\overline{z}}=\psi(z).\]
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    In the first part, we established that a function \(\psi(z)\in C^0(\mathbb{C})\) with compact support satisfies \[u(z)=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{\psi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta\in C^0(\mathbb{C}).\]
    If \(\psi(z)\in C^1(\mathbb{C})\), then the first order derivatives of \(u(z)\) can be written in the same form (equations \eqref{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr_realaxisderivative} and \eqref{eq:onedimensionalpartialconjugatesolution_differenceexpr_imaginaryaxisderivative}) since \(\pdv{\psi}{\alpha},\pdv{\psi}{\beta}\in C^0(\mathbb{C})\) and are also compactly supported. Then they too are continuous functions, and \(u(z)\in C^1(\mathbb{C})\).

    Then using the same argument, In general, for \(\psi(z)\in C^k(\mathbb{C})\), the same process can be used recursively to find that \(u(z)\in C^k(\mathbb{C})\) as well.
\end{remark}
\subsection{The Cauchy--Goursat Theorem}
When Cauchy famously published \autoref{thm:cauchyintegralformula} and \autoref{thm:cauchyintegraltheorem}, he included the condition for \(f(z)\in C^1\paren{\overline{U}}\). It was later proved that all holomorphic functions had holomorphic derivatives, and this condition was dropped by Goursat using an argument involving the triangulation of polygonal chains.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:integralpiecewisesmoothtopolygonalchain}
    Let \(f:G\to\mathbb{C}\) be a continuous function defined for a region \(G\subseteq\mathbb{C}\). Let \(\Gamma\subset G\) be a rectifiable piecewise smooth curve. Then \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), there exists a polygonal chain \(P\subset G\) inscribing \(\Gamma\) (each vertex lies on \(\Gamma\)) where \[\abs{\int_{\Gamma}f(z)\ddz-\int_{P}f(z)\ddz}<\varepsilon.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Because \(f\in C^0(G)\), there is a compact set \(D\subseteq G\) enclosing \(\Gamma\) and is the closure of some open set. By \autoref{lemma:uniformcontinuousovercompactset}, \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), \(\exists\delta>0\) such that \(\forall z',z''\in D\) satisfying \(\abs{z''-z'}<\delta\), \(\abs{f\paren{z''}-f\paren{z'}}<\varepsilon\). Partition \(\Gamma\) into \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) curves \(\gamma_0,\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_{n-1}\) between points \(z_0,z_1,\ldots z_n\) such that \(\forall k\in\left\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\right\}\) the length of \(\gamma_k\) is less than \(\delta\). Then, \(\forall k\in\left\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\right\}\), let \(l_k\) denote the straight line segment connecting \(z_k\) and \(z_{k+1}\). The length of \(l_k\) is less than \(\delta\) as well. Then let \[P=\bigcup_{k=0}^{n-1}\overline{l_k}.\] Over the partition formed with \(\gamma_k\), the integral \begin{equation*}
        \int_{\Gamma}f(z)\ddz
    \end{equation*} can be approximated with the Riemann sum \[S=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f\paren{z_k}\Delta z_k\] where \[\Delta z_k=z_{k+1}-z_k=\int_{\gamma_k}\ddz=\int_{l_k}\ddz.\]
    Then the sum above can be written as \[S=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\int_{\gamma_k}f\paren{z_k}\ddz=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\int_{l_k}f\paren{z_k}\ddz,\] and it follows that \[\abs{\int_{\Gamma}f(z)\ddz-S}=\abs{\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\int_{\gamma_k}\brackets{f(z)-f\paren{z_k}}\ddz}<\varepsilon \mu(\Gamma)\] and \[\abs{\int_{P}f(z)\ddz-S}=\abs{\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\int_{l_k}\brackets{f(z)-f\paren{z_k}}\ddz}<\varepsilon \mu(P)<\varepsilon \mu(\Gamma)\] where \(\mu(\Gamma)\) is the length of \(\Gamma\) and \(\mu(P)\) is the length of \(P\).
    Then, \[\abs{\int_{\Gamma}f(z)\ddz-\int_{P}f(z)\ddz}\leq\abs{\int_{\Gamma}f(z)\ddz-S}+\abs{\int_{P}f(z)\ddz-S}\leq 2\varepsilon\mu(\Gamma),\] which proves the result.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset}
    Given a holomorphic function \(f(z)\) on a simply connected set \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\), for any piecewise smooth closed curve \(\Gamma\subset U\), \begin{equation}
        \int_\Gamma f(\zeta)\ddzeta=0.\label{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_statement}
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By \autoref{lemma:integralpiecewisesmoothtopolygonalchain}, \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), there is a polygonal chain \(P\) where
    \begin{equation}
        \abs{\int_{\Gamma}f(z)\ddz-\int_{P}f(z)\ddz}<\varepsilon.\label{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_chaindefinition}
    \end{equation} The statement we aim to prove is equivalent to proving that \begin{equation}
        \int_{P}f(z)\ddz=0.\label{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_chainvanishingstatement}

                                      & \quad+\int_{\overrightarrow{BE}}f(z)\ddz+\int_{\overrightarrow{EB}}f(z)\ddz+\int_{\overrightarrow{CE}}f(z)\ddz+\int_{\overrightarrow{EC}}f(z)\ddz                               \\
                                      & =\int_{\Delta{ABE}}f(z)\ddz+\int_{\Delta{BCE}}f(z)\ddz+\int_{\Delta{CDE}}f(z)\ddz.
    \end{align*} Thus, if the integral over every triangle in \(U\) vanishes, then \eqref{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_statement} follows. Consider a triangle in \(U\) with boundary \(\Delta\). \begin{figure}

        \label{fig:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_trianglequadrisection}
    \end{figure} Then define \(M\) to be \[M=\abs{\int_{\Delta}f(z)\ddz}.\]
    Quadrisect the triangle bounded by \(\Delta\) into four triangles with boundaries \(\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\Delta_3,\Delta_4\) as in \autoref{fig:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_trianglequadrisection}. Then one of \(\Delta_1\), \(\Delta_2\), \(\Delta_3,\), and \(\Delta_4\) (denote this to be \(\Delta^1\)) satisfy
    \[\int_{\Delta^1}f(z)\ddz\geq\frac{M}{4},\]
    and recursively, choose \begin{equation}
        \int_{\Delta^2}f(z)\ddz\geq\frac{M}{4^2},\ldots,\int_{\Delta^n}f(z)\ddz\geq\frac{M}{4^n}. \label{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_trianglelowerbound}
    \end{equation} Let \(L\) denote the perimeter of \(\Delta\). Then, the perimeters of \(\Delta^1, \Delta^2,\ldots\) are \(\frac{L}{2},\frac{L}{2^2},\ldots\) respectively. As \(n\to\infty\), \(\Delta_n\) shrinks to a single point \(z_0\). Then, \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), \(z_0\in\Delta^n\). 

    By the definition of holomorphy, \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), \(\exists\delta>0\) such that \(\forall z\in D\paren{z_0,\delta}\), \[\abs{\frac{f\paren{z}-f\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}-f'\paren{z_0}}<\varepsilon,\]\[\abs{f\paren{z}-f\paren{z_0}-f'\paren{z_0}\paren{z-z_0}}<\varepsilon\abs{z-z_0}.\] and \(\exists N\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(\forall n\in \mathbb{N}_{>N}\), \(\Delta^n\subset D\paren{z_0,\delta}\). By \autoref{thm:cauchyintegraltheorem}, since the functions \(1\) and \(z\) are both entire, \[\int_{\Delta^n}\ddz=0,\quad\int_{\Delta^n}z\ddz=0.\] Then 
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{\Delta^n}f(z)\ddz&=\int_{\Delta^n}f(z)\ddz-f\paren{z_0}\int_{\Delta^n}\ddz-f'\paren{z_0}\left(\int_{\Delta^n}z\ddz-z_0\int_{\Delta^n}\ddz\right)\\
        &=\int_{\Delta^n}\brackets{f(z)-f\paren{z_0}-f'\paren{z_0}\paren{z-z_0}}\ddz.
    \end{align*}
    Because the distance between any two points in the interior of a triangle is always less than its perimeter, using the triangle inequality for complex integrals, \[\int_{\Delta^n}\abs{f(z)}\abs{\ddz}\leq\varepsilon\int_{\Delta^n}\abs{z-z_0}\abs{\ddz}=\frac{\varepsilon L}{2^n}\int_{\Delta^n}\abs{\ddz}=\frac{\varepsilon L^2}{4^n}.\]
    Comparing the above equation with equation \eqref{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_trianglelowerbound}, \[\frac{M}{4^n}<\frac{\varepsilon L}{4^n},\quad M<\varepsilon L.\] Since \(\Delta\) is rectifiable, \(L\) is finite, and letting \(\varepsilon\to0\), we find that \(M\to0\). Then, for every triangle in \(U\), the integral vanishes, and equations \eqref{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_chainvanishingstatement} and \eqref{eq:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset_chaindefinition} follow.

\begin{theorem}[Cauchy--Goursat Integral Theorem]\label{thm:cauchygoursattheorem}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be an open region bounded with a simple closed boundary \(\partial U\). Let \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) be a holomorphic function continuous on \(\overline{U}\). Then, \[\oint_{\partial U}f(\zeta)\ddzeta=0.\]
\end{theorem}

        \caption{A simplified region containing two vertical lines and two continuous, rectifiable curves.}
        \label{fig:cauchygoursattheorem_simplifiedregion}
    \end{figure}

    First assume \(U\) has the shape of \(MNQP\) in \autoref{fig:cauchygoursattheorem_simplifiedregion}. That is, \(U\) consists of \(x=a\), \(x=b\) for \(a<b\), and two rectifiable \(C^0\) curves \(\overrightarrow{MN}:y=\varphi(x)\) and \(\overrightarrow{QP}:\psi(x)\) such that \(\varphi(x)<\psi(x)\), \(\forall a\le x\le b\).

    For some \(\varepsilon>0\), \(\eta>0\), construct a new curve \(M_1'N_1'Q_1'P_1'\in U\) to be the boundary of the region bounded by \(P_1M_1:x=a+\varepsilon\), \(N_1Q_1:b-\varepsilon\), \(M'N':\varphi(x)+\eta\), and \(Q'P': \psi(x)-\eta\) such that \(M_1'N_1'Q_1'P_1'\) remains simple. By \autoref{lemma:cauchyintegraltheoremoversimplyconnectedset}, \[\oint_{M_1'N_1'Q_1'P_1'}f(z)\ddz=0.\]
    By \autoref{lemma:uniformcontinuousovercompactset}, \(f(z)\) is uniformly continuous over \(\overline{U}\), and therefore \(\forall\varepsilon'>0\), we can choose \(\eta>0\) so that \(\forall z\in\overrightarrow{M_1'N_1'}\), \(\abs{f\paren{z}-f\paren{z-\eta}}<\varepsilon'\) is satisfied. Letting \(\eta\to0\) (with \(\varepsilon'\to0\)) and fixing \(\varepsilon>0\), we get that 
    \[\abs{\int_{\overrightarrow{M_1'N_1'}}f(z)\ddz-\int_{\overrightarrow{M_1N_1}}f(z)\ddz}\leq\int_{\overrightarrow{M_1'N_1'}}\abs{f(z)-f\paren{z-\eta}}\abs{\ddz}<\varepsilon'\int_{\overrightarrow{M_1'N_1'}}\abs{dz}\to0,\] and consequently, \begin{equation}
        \int_{\overrightarrow{M_1'N_1'}}f(z)\ddz\to \int_{\overrightarrow{M_1N_1}}f(z)\ddz.\label{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerhorizontaltoouterinnerhorizontal1}
    \end{equation}
    Under the same limit, we get \begin{equation}
        \int_{\overrightarrow{Q_1'P_1'}}f(z)\ddz\to \int_{\overrightarrow{Q_1P_1}}f(z)\ddz.\label{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerhorizontaltoouterinnerhorizontal2}
    \end{equation} By the continuity of \(f(z)\) over a compact set, \begin{equation}
        \int_{\overrightarrow{P_1'M_1'}}f(z)\ddz\to \int_{\overrightarrow{P_1M_1}}f(z)\ddz,\quad\int_{\overrightarrow{N_1'Q_1'}}f(z)\ddz\to \int_{\overrightarrow{N_1Q_1}}f(z)\ddz.\label{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerverticaltoouterinnervertical}
    \end{equation}
    Then letting \(\varepsilon\to0\), for the same reason as equation \eqref{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerverticaltoouterinnervertical}, equations \eqref{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerhorizontaltoouterinnerhorizontal1} and \eqref{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerhorizontaltoouterinnerhorizontal2} yield \[\int_{\overrightarrow{M_1N_1}}f(z)\ddz\to \int_{\overrightarrow{MN}}f(z)\ddz,\quad\int_{\overrightarrow{Q_1P_1}}f(z)\ddz\to \int_{\overrightarrow{QP}}f(z)\ddz.\]
    We are left to show the subsequent limits of the results from equation \eqref{eq:cauchygoursattheorem_innerinnerverticaltoouterinnervertical}. For the left integral, let \(y_{\varphi}=\max\paren{\varphi(a),\varphi\paren{a+\varepsilon}}\) and \(y_{\psi}=\max\paren{\psi(a),\psi\paren{a+\varepsilon}}\).

    Then, \[\int_{\overrightarrow{PM}}f(z)\ddz=i\int_{\psi(a)}^{\varphi(a)}f\paren{a+iy}\ddy=i\paren{\int_{\psi(a)}^{y_\varphi}+\int_{y_\varphi}^{y_\psi}+\int_{y_\psi}^{\varphi(a)}}f(a+iy)\ddy.\]
    Similarly, \[\int_{\overrightarrow{P_1M_1}}f(z)\ddz=i\paren{\int_{\psi(a+\varepsilon)}^{y_\varphi}+\int_{y_\varphi}^{y_\psi}+\int_{y_\psi}^{\varphi(a+\varepsilon)}}f(a+\varepsilon+iy)\ddy.\]
    The difference \(\paren{\int_{\overrightarrow{PM}}-\int_{\overrightarrow{P_1M_1}}}f(z)\ddz\) between the two is then equal to \begin{gather*}
        i\int_{y_{\varphi}}^{y_{\psi}}\paren{f\paren{a+iy}-f\paren{a+\varepsilon+iy}}\ddz\\
        {}+{i\paren{\int_{\psi(a)}^{y_\varphi}+\int_{y_\psi}^{\varphi(a)}}f(a+iy)-i\paren{\int_{\psi(a+\varepsilon)}^{y_\varphi}z+\int_{y_\psi}^{\varphi\paren{a+\varepsilon}}}f(a+\varepsilon+iy)}.
    \end{gather*}
    The first term vanishes by uniform continuity (same argument used for \(M_1'N_1'\to M_1N_1\)) and the remaining four integrals all equal 0 as they are all integrable on a degenerating interval (as \(\varepsilon\to0\), \(y_\varphi\to\varphi(a)\) and \(y_\psi\to\psi(a)\) because \(\varphi, \psi\in C^0\)). Therefore, \[\int_{\overrightarrow{P_1M_1}}f(z)\ddz\to\int_{\overrightarrow{PM}}f(z)\ddz,\]
    and through similar logic, \[\int_{\overrightarrow{N_1Q_1}}f(z)\ddz\to\int_{\overrightarrow{NQ}}f(z)\ddz.\] Therefore, \[\oint_{MNQP}f(z)\ddz=0.\]
    Any open region \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) with a simple closed boundary can be broken up into smaller regions with the same form as \(MNQP\) with finitely many auxiliary lines. Then the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    The theorem is also valid for any multiply connected region (and its boundary will consist of multiple curves) as a multiply connected region is equal to the union of several simply connected regions with vertical auxiliary lines between.

    Additionally, if \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) is simply connected and \(f\) is holomorphic on \(U\), then for any two points \(z,z_0\in U\), the integral \[\int_{z_0}^zf(\zeta)\ddzeta\] is well-defined and independent of the path taken from \(z_0\) to \(z\). In this sense, a holomorphic function behaves analogously to a potential field.
\end{remark} 
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy--Goursat Integral Formula]\label{thm:cauchygoursatformula}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be an open region bounded with a simple closed boundary \(\partial U \), and let \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) be a holomorphic function continuous on \(\overline{U}\). Then for all \(z\in U\),
    \begin{equation}
        f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta.\label{eq:cauchygoursatformula}
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By the Cauchy--Goursat Integral Theorem (\autoref{thm:cauchygoursattheorem}), \[\int_{\partial\paren{U\setminus D(z,\varepsilon)}}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta=\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta-\oint_{\partial D(z,\varepsilon)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta=0.\]
    From rearrangement, \[\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta=2\pi if(z)+i\int_0^{2\pi}\paren{f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)}\dd{t}.\]
    Since \(f\in C^0(\partial D(z,\varepsilon))\), as \(\varepsilon\to0\), \begin{align*}
        \abs{\int_0^{2\pi}\paren{f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)}\dd{t}}&\leq\int_0^{2\pi}\abs{f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)}\dd{t}\\
        &\leq2\pi\max\abs{f\paren{z+\varepsilon e^{it}}-f(z)}\to0.
    \end{align*}
    By rearrangement, \[f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta.\]
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    In the proof of \autoref{thm:pompeiu}, we used Lipschitz continuity for a smooth function, which was a stronger condition than necessary. The true necessity of smoothness was to be able to apply Green's Theorem (\autoref{thm:complexgreen}).
\end{remark}
\subsection{Analyticity and Holomorphy}\label{sec:analyticityandholomorphy}
The Cauchy--Goursat Integral Formula (\autoref{thm:cauchygoursatformula}) can also be generalized into a result that equates complex integration and differentiation:
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy--Goursat Differentiation Formula]\label{thm:cauchydifferentiationformula}
    Let \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) be an open region bounded by a simple closed boundary \(\partial U\), and let \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic and continuous over \(\overline{U}\). Then \(\forall z\in U\), \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), \(f^{(n)}(z)\) exists, and 
    \begin{equation}
        f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z}^{n+1}}\ddzeta.\label{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_statement}
    \end{equation}
    Additionally, since \(U\) is open, \(\forall z_0\in U\), \(\exists r>0\) such that the closed disk \(\overline{D\paren{z_0,r}}\subset U\). Then \(\forall z\in\overline{D\paren{z_0,r}}\), \(f(z)\) has the uniformly and absolutely convergent Taylor expansion 
    \begin{equation}
        f(z)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j\paren{z-z_0}^j,\label{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_taylorseries}
    \end{equation}
    where \begin{equation}
        a_j=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z}^{j+1}}\ddzeta.\label{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_taylorseriescoefficients}
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \(\forall z_0\in U\), \(\forall z\in D\paren{z_0,r}\subset U\), by \autoref{thm:cauchygoursatformula}, \[f(z)-f\paren{z_0}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\paren{\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}-\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}}\ddzeta=\frac{z-z_0}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\paren{\zeta-z}\paren{\zeta-z_0}},\]
    and dividing by \(z-z_0\), the above is equal to \[\frac{f(z)-f\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\paren{\zeta-z}\paren{\zeta-z_0}}.\]
    Since \begin{align}
        \frac{f(z)-f\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\ddzeta}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^2}&=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f\paren{\zeta}}{\zeta-z_0}\paren{\frac{1}{\zeta-z}-\frac{1}{\zeta-z_0}}\ddzeta\nonumber\\
        &=\frac{z-z_0}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)\paren{\zeta-z_0}^2}\ddzeta.\label{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_differenceoffirstorderdifferences}
    \end{align}
    Let \(d\) be the distance from \(z_0\) to \(\partial U\), and choose \(r=\frac{d}{2}\). Then, since \(\abs{z-z_0}<\frac{d}{2}\) and \(\abs{\zeta-z_0}\geq d\), \(\abs{\zeta-z}\geq\frac{d}{2}\). Then the absolute value of the integrand of equation \eqref{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_differenceoffirstorderdifferences} is bounded above by \(\frac{2M}{d^3}\), where \(M\) is the maximum of \(f(\zeta)\), which exists by \autoref{thm:continuousfunctionboundedoncompact}. Then, \[\abs{\frac{z-z_0}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)\paren{\zeta-z_0}^2}\ddzeta}\leq\frac{\abs{z-z_0}}{\pi}\frac{M}{d^3}\oint_{\partial U}\abs{\ddzeta}.\] As \(z\to z_0\), the difference vanishes, and therefore, \[f'\paren{z_0}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^2}\ddzeta.\]
    Now inductively assume that equation \eqref{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_statement} is true for a given \(n=k\in\mathbb{N}\), or \[f^{(k)}(z)=\frac{k!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z}^{k+1}}\ddzeta.\]
    Notice the expansion of the kernel, convergent since \(\abs{z-z_0}<\abs{\zeta-z_0}\):
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{1}{\zeta-z}=\frac{1}{\zeta-z_0}\cdot\frac{\zeta-z_0}{\zeta-z}=\frac{1}{\zeta-z_0}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta-z_0}}=\frac{1}{\zeta-z_0}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\paren{\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta-z_0}}^j.\label{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_kernelexpansion}
    \end{equation}
    Then, \begin{align*}
        f^{(k)}(z)&=\frac{k!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{k+1}}\ddzeta\\
        &=\frac{k!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{k+1}}\paren{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\paren{\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta-z_0}}^j}^{k+1}\ddzeta\\
        &=f^{(k)}\paren{z_0}+\frac{(k+1)!\paren{z-z_0}}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{k+2}}\ddzeta\\
        &\quad+O\paren{\abs{z-z_0}^2},
    \end{align*}
    where the remainder terms have a form resembling \[O\paren{\abs{z-z_0}^2}=\paren{z-z_0}^2\frac{k!}{2\pi i}\brackets{k+1+\begin{pmatrix}k+1\\2\end{pmatrix}}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{k+3}}\ddzeta+O\paren{\abs{z-z_0}^3}.\]
    The difference quotient is equal to \[\frac{f^{(k)}(z)-f^{(k)}\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}=\frac{(k+1)!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{k+2}}\ddzeta+O\abs{z-z_0}.\] As \(z\to z_0\), the remainder terms vanish, and \[f^{(k+1)}\paren{z_0}=\frac{(k+1)!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{k+2}}\ddzeta.\]
    By induction, equation \eqref{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_statement} is valid. By substituting equation \eqref{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_kernelexpansion} into \eqref{eq:cauchygoursatformula}, we obtain \[f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\paren{\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta-z_0}}^j\ddzeta=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\paren{z-z_0}^j\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{j+1}}\ddzeta.\] 
    Because \(f(\zeta)\) is continuous over \(\partial U\), it is bounded by a constant \(M\). Additionally, since \(\abs{z-z_0}<\abs{\zeta-z_0}\), the sum is termwise bounded by the convergent series \[\sum_{j=0}^\infty\abs{z-z_0}^j\frac{M}{\abs{\zeta-z_0}^{j+1}}.\]
    By the Weierstrass \(M\)--Test (\autoref{thm:weierstrassmtest}), the series uniformly converges, and we can justify \[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial U}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\paren{z-z_0}^j\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{j+1}}\ddzeta=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\oint_{\partial U}\paren{z-z_0}^j\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{j+1}}\ddzeta=\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j\paren{z-z_0}^j,\]
    which verifies equations \eqref{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_taylorseries} and \eqref{eq:cauchydifferentiationformula_taylorseriescoefficients}.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    By induction, we have shown that assuming the existence of the first order derivative of a holomorphic function \(f\), the \(n\)th order derivative of \(f\) exists \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\) and is holomorphic over the same region as \(f^{(n-1)}\). Furthermore, if \(f\) is holomorphic, then \(\forall z\in U\), there exists an open disk enclosing \(z\) such that \(f\) has a convergent Taylor Series expansion. This property is known as \textit{analyticity}, and \autoref{thm:cauchydifferentiationformula} tells us that all holomorphic functions are analytic. Analytic functions can be expanded into power series, which are termwise differentiable, and therefore complex differentiable. Thus, analyticity and holomorphy are logically equivalent, which is a fundamental difference between real and complex functions.
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Estimate]\label{thm:cauchysestimate}
    For a function \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) holomorphic over \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) and \(\forall z_0\in U\) and \(\forall R>0\) such that \(\overline{D\paren{z_0,R}}\subseteq{U}\), \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), \[\abs{f^{(n)}\paren{z_0}}\leq\frac{n!M}{R^n},\]
    where \[M=\max_{z\in\overline{D\paren{z_0,R}}}\abs{f(z)}.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By the Cauchy--Goursat Differentiation Formula (\autoref{thm:cauchydifferentiationformula}), \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), \[f^{(n)}\paren{z_0}=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial D\paren{z_0,R}}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\paren{\zeta-z_0}^{n+1}}\ddzeta.\]
    Because \(f(z)\) is continuous over the boundary \(\partial D\paren{z_0,R}\), it is bounded by \(M\). Thus,
    \[\abs{f^{(n)}\paren{z_0}}\leq\frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{M}{\paren{e^{it}R}^{n+1}}e^{it}R\dd{t}=\frac{n!M}{R^n}.\]
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Liouville's Theorem]\label{thm:liouville}
    Any bounded entire function is constant.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) be entire. Then, \(\forall z_0\in\mathbb{C}\), \(\forall R>0\), \(f\) is holomorphic over \(\overline{D\paren{z_0,R}}\). By \autoref{thm:cauchysestimate}, \[\abs{f'\paren{z_0}}\leq\frac{M}{R},\] where \(M=\sup_{z\in\mathbb{C}}\abs{f(z)}\). By letting \(r\to\infty\), \(f'\paren{z_0}\) where \(z_0\) is any arbitrary value in \(\mathbb{C}\). Therefore, \(f(z)\) is constant.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Morera's Theorem]\label{thm:morera}
    Let \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) and \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) be continuous over \(U\). If for any rectifiable closed curve \(\gamma\subset U\), \[\oint_{\gamma}f(\zeta)\ddzeta\] vanishes, then \(f\) is holomorphic over \(U\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Since the integral vanishes on any closed curve \(\gamma\), \(\forall z_0,z\in U\), the integral is path independent with endpoints \(z_0\) and \(z\):
    \[F(z)=\int_{z_0}^zf(\zeta)\ddzeta.\]
    As \(f(z)\) is continuous over \(U\), \(F(z)\) is continuous over \(U\) as well. \(F(z)\) is holomorphic over \(U\) (complex differentiable with \(F'(z)=f(z)\)), and by \autoref{thm:cauchydifferentiationformula}, the derivative of \(F(z)\), \(f(z)\) is also holomorphic over \(U\).
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:nthderivativeboundedl1norm}
    Let \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) be open, let \(K\subset U\) be compact and \(V\supset K\) be open such that \(\overline{V}\subset U\) (\(V\) is a neighborhood of \(K\) that is relatively compact in \(U\)). Let \(f(z)\) be holomorphic in \(U\). Then there exists a sequence \(\paren{c_n}\) such that \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), \begin{equation}
        \sup_{z\in K}\abs{f^{(n)}(z)}\leq c_n\left\|f\right\|_{L_1(V)},\label{eq:nthderivativeboundedl1norm_statement}
    \end{equation}
    where \(\left\|f\right\|_{L_p(V)}\) denotes \[\paren{\int_V\abs{f(z)}^p\ddx\wedge\ddy}^{\flatfrac{1}{p}}.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(\varphi\in C^\infty\paren{\mathbb{C}}\)  satisfy \(\supp(\varphi)\subset V\) and be identically equal to 1 over some open neighborhood \(W\) of \(K\) relatively compact in \(V\). Since \(f\in C^\infty\paren{U}\), by the Cauchy--Pompeiu Theorem (\autoref{thm:pompeiu}) on \(f(z)\varphi(z)\in C^\infty\paren{\overline{U}}\), \[f(z)\varphi(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\paren{\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)\varphi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\ddzeta-\int_{U}\pdv{f(\zeta)\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}}.\]
    By the product rule, \[\pdv{f(\zeta)\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}=\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}f(\zeta),\] and since \(\partial U\subset\mathbb{C}\setminus\supp(\varphi)\), the first term vanishes, resulting in \[f(z)\varphi(z)=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_U\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}f(\zeta)\cdot\frac{\dd{\overline{\zeta}}\wedge\ddzeta}{\zeta-z}.\] Let \(K_1\) denote \(\supp\paren{\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}}\), and \(\forall z\in K\), \(\varphi(z)=1\). Therefore, \[f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{K_1}f(\zeta)\cdot\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}}{\zeta-z}.\]
    We can differentiate within the integral as \(f(\zeta)\cdot\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}\) is \(C^\infty\) and bounded over \(K_1\), and thus the integrand is termwise dominated by an integrable function independent of \(\zeta\):
    \[f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{K_1} f(\zeta)\cdot\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}\cdot\frac{\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}}{\paren{\zeta-z}^{n+1}},\]
    and by the triangle inequality,
    \[\abs{f^{(n)}(z)}\leq\frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{K_1} \abs{f(\zeta)}\abs{\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}}\frac{\abs{\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}}}{\abs{\zeta-z}^{n+1}}.\]
    Notice that over \(W\), \(\varphi=1\), \(\varphi'=0\), and is disjoint from \(K_1\) (or that \(W\cap K_1=\emptyset\)). Then, the distance between \(W\) and \(K\) is positive and the two are disjoint. Therefore, \(\exists M>0\) such that 
    \[\frac{1}{\abs{\zeta-z}}\leq M,\] and thus, \[\abs{\pdv{\varphi(\zeta)}{\overline{\zeta}}}\frac{1}{\abs{\zeta-z}^{n+1}}\] can be bounded by a sequence \(\paren{c'_n}\), independent of \(f\) and only of \(n\) and the sets \(K\) and \(V\). Then, \[\abs{f^{(n)}(z)}\leq\frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{K_1}c'_n\abs{f(\zeta)}{\abs{\ddzeta\wedge\dd{\overline{\zeta}}}}=\frac{n!}{\pi}\int_{K_1}c'_n\abs{f(\zeta)}{\abs{\ddx\wedge\ddy}}.\] Because \(K_1\) is compact, it has a finite area \(\mu\paren{K_1}\), and we can define a new sequence \(c_n=\frac{n!}{\pi}c'_n\mu\paren{K_1}\) to find that \[\abs{f^{(n)}(z)}\leq c_n\int_{K_1}\abs{f(\zeta)}{\abs{\ddx\wedge\ddy}}\leq c_n\int_{V}\abs{f(\zeta)}{\abs{\ddx\wedge\ddy}}.\]

    The problem now stands to prove that \(\varphi(z)\) exists in the first place, which is discussed later in \autoref{thm:bumpfunctionexistence}.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    Let \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) be open, let \(K\subset U\) be compact and \(V\supset K\) be open such that \(\overline{V}\subset U\). For any holomorphic function \(f(z)\) in \(U\), there exist constants (with respect to \(z\)) \(\paren{c_n}\) such that \[\sup_{z\in K}\abs{f^{(n)}(z)}\leq c_n\sup_{z\in V}\abs{f(z)}.\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Starting from equation \eqref{eq:nthderivativeboundedl1norm_statement}, observe that \[c_n\left\|f\right\|_{L_1(V)}\leq c_n\mu(V)\sup_{z\in V}\abs{f(z)},\] and we can define a new set of constants equal to \(c_n\mu(V)\), which are still independent of \(z\).
\end{proof}
For the next theorem we will briefly introduce the concept of \textit{analytic continuation}.
\begin{definition}[Analytic Continuation]
    Let \(U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) be a region, let \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic, and 
    let \(V\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) be a region with \(U\subseteq V\). A function 
    \(F:V\to\mathbb{C}\) is an \textit{analytic continuation} of \(f\) to \(V\) if:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(F\) is holomorphic on \(V\), and
        \item \(F(z)=f(z)\) for all \(z\in U\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Riemann's Theorem for Removable Singularities]
    Let \(\tilde{D}\paren{z_0,r}=D\paren{z_0,r}\setminus\cbraces{z_0}\), and \(F:\tilde{D}\paren{z_0,r}\to\mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic and bounded. Then \(F\) can be analytically continued to \(D\paren{z_0,r}\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Define \[G(z)=\begin{cases}
        \paren{z-z_0}^2F(z)&z\in\tilde{D}\paren{z_0,r}\\
        0&z=z_0
    \end{cases}.\]
    \(G(z)\) is bounded and continuously differentiable on \(D\paren{z_0,r}\) and satisfies the Cauchy--Riemann Equations since 
    \[\lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{G(z)-G\paren{z_0}}{z-z_0}=\frac{\paren{z-z_0}^2F(z)}{z-z_0}=\lim_{z\to z_0}\paren{z-z_0}F(z)=0,\] meaning that \(\dv{G}{z}\paren{z_0}=0\). For \(z\in\tilde{D}\paren{z_0,r}\), \(G'(z)=2\paren{z-z_0}F(z)+\paren{z-z_0}^2F'(z)\). As \(z\to z_0\), \(G(z)\to0\), meaning that \(G\) is holomorphic over \(D\paren{z_0,r}\). By \autoref{thm:cauchydifferentiationformula}, \[G(z)=\sum_{j=2}^\infty a_j\paren{z-z_0}^j,\]
    which is convergent over \(D\paren{z_0,r}\). Then we can define \[f(z)=\frac{G(z)}{\paren{z-z_0}^2}=\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_{j+2}\paren{z-z_0}^j\] over the same disk of convergence. Over the punctured disk, \(f(z)=F(z)\), and therefore \(f\) is an analytic continuation of \(F\).
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    
\end{theorem}
\subsubsection{Existence of Bump Functions}
\begin{definition}[Topological Space]
    A \textit{topological space} is a pair \((X, \tau)\), where \(X\) is a set and \(\tau\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) satisfying the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\emptyset\in\tau\) and \(X\in\tau\),
        \item The union of any collection of sets in \(\tau\) is also in \(\tau\),
        \item The intersection of any finite number of sets in \(\tau\) is also in \(\tau\).
    \end{enumerate}
    The collection \(\tau\) is called a \textit{topology} on \(X\), and its elements are referred to as \textit{open sets} under the topology \(\tau\).
\end{definition}
A topology allows the definition and general conceptualization of continuity, convergence, and connectedness in a general setting, without necessarily relying on a notion of distance (a metric).

For example, in a topological space, a function \(f:X\to Y\) between two topological spaces is said to be continuous if the preimage of every open set in \(Y\) is an open set in \(X\). This generalizes the familiar \(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition of continuity from calculus.
\begin{example}
    To illustrate this, consider the function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) defined by
    \[f(x)= \begin{cases}
        1&x\geq0, \\
        0&x<0.\end{cases}
    \]
    We equip both the domain and codomain with the standard topology on \(\mathbb{R}\).
    Let us examine the open set \(V = (0.5, 1.5) \subseteq \mathbb{R}\). Then the preimage of \(V\) is \[f^{-1}(V) = \{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid f(x)\in(0.5,1.5)\}=[0, \infty),\]
    which is not an open set in the standard topology on \(\mathbb{R}\).
\end{example}
\begin{definition}[Basis of a Topology]
    For a topological space \((X,\tau)\), a \textit{basis} \(\mathcal{B}\subseteq\tau\) is a subcollection of \(\tau\) such that every set in \(\tau\) is equal to the union of a subcollection of \(\mathcal{B}\).
\end{definition}
It is easy to see that \(\mathcal{B}\) forms an open cover of \(X\). For any two sets in a topology, their intersection is also in the topology, which means there is a set in the basis of the topology that is a subset of the intersection. 

In other words, \(\forall B_1,B_2\in\mathcal{B}\), \(\forall x\in B_1\cap B_2\), \(\exists B_3\in\mathcal{B}\) such that \(x\in B_3\) and \(B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2\).
\begin{definition}[Exhaustion by Compact Sets]\label{def:exhaustionbycompactsets}
    For a topological space \(X\), an \textit{exhaustion by compact sets} is a nested sequence of compact sets \(\paren{K_n}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq X\), such that \(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\), \(K_n\subset K_{n+1}^\circ\), and \[X=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}K_n\]
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:locallyfiniteopencoverexistence}
    Let \(\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) be an open set and \(\mathfrak{B}\) be an (open) basis of (the standard topology under) \(\Omega\). Then there exists a collection of sets \(\left\{U_n\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\) in \(\mathfrak{B}\) such that \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}U_n=\Omega\).
        \item \(\forall K\subset\Omega\) that is compact, \(K\) intersects only a finite number of sets in \(\left\{U_n\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(K_{-1}=K_0=\emptyset,K_1,K_2,\cdots\subset\Omega\) exhaust \(\Omega\), with each \(K_n\) compact and \(K_n\subseteq K_{n+1}^\circ\). For each \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), define \(W_n=K_{n+1}^\circ\setminus K_{n-2}\), which is open, and \(V_n=K_n\setminus K_{n-1}^\circ\), which is compact.

    By construction, \(V_n\subseteq W_n\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). The sets \(\{V_n\}\) form compact shells covering \(\Omega\), since \(\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}V_n=\Omega\).

    For each \(r\in\mathbb{N}\) and each \(z\in V_r\), since \(W_r\) is an open set containing \(z\) and \(\mathfrak{B}\) is a basis, there exists \(U_{z,r}\in\mathfrak{B}\) such that \(z\in U_{z,r}\subseteq W_r\). The collection \(\{U_{z,r}\mid z\in V_r\}\) is an open cover of the compact set \(V_r\), so by the Heine-Borel theorem it admits a finite subcover. That is, there exist finitely many points \(z_{r,1},\ldots,z_{r,k_r}\) such that \(V_r\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{k_r}U_{z_{r,i},r}\subseteq W_r\).

    Let \(\{U_j\}\) be the collection formed by enumerating all such \(U_{z_{r,i},r}\) for \(r\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(i=1,\ldots,k_r\). Then \(\{U_j\}\subset\mathfrak{B}\) is a countable collection whose union covers \(\Omega\), proving condition 1.

    For condition 2, let \(K\subset\Omega\) be compact. Then \(K\subset K_N^\circ\) for some \(N\in\mathbb{N}\), and hence \(K\) is disjoint from \(V_n\) for all \(n>N+1\). Since each \(V_n\) intersects only finitely many \(U_j\), it follows that \(K\) intersects only finitely many of the \(U_j\). Thus, the collection is \textit{locally finite}.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Partition of Unity]\label{thm:partitionofunity}
    For a nonempty open set \(\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{C}\), let \(\cbraces{\Omega_i}_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}}\) be an open cover of \(\Omega\). Then there exists a set of bump functions, \(\alpha_1(z),\alpha_2(z),\ldots\in C^\infty(\mathbb{C})\) with compact support within \(\Omega\) satisfying
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\forall j\in\mathbb{N}\), \(\exists k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\) such that \(\supp\paren{\alpha_j}\subseteq\Omega_k\).
        \item \(\forall j\in\mathbb{N}\), \(0\leq\alpha_j\leq 1\).
        \item \(\forall z\in\Omega\), \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \alpha_j(z)=1,\)
    \end{enumerate} known as a \(C^\infty\) partition of unity subordinate to \(\cbraces{\Omega_i}\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By the openness of \(\Omega_i\), \(\forall z\in\Omega\), \(\exists r_z>0\) such that \(\overline{D\paren{z,r_z}}\subset\Omega_{k_z}\) for some \(k_z\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}\). \(\forall z\in\Omega\), \(\forall 0<r<r_z\), \(\cbraces{D\paren{z,r_z}}\) forms an open basis of \(\Omega\). Then by \autoref{lemma:locallyfiniteopencoverexistence}, there exists a locally finite open cover \(\cbraces{D\paren{z_j,r_{z_j}}}\) of \(\Omega\), and since it is a subcollection of the basis, \[D\paren{z_j,r_{z_j}}\subset\overline{D\paren{z_j,r_{z_j}}}\subset\Omega_{k_{z_j}},\quad\forall j\in\mathbb{N}.\] The most trivial bump function has the form \[\theta(z)=\begin{cases}
        e^{\frac{1}{\abs{z}-1}}&\abs{z}<1\\
        0&\abs{z}\ge1
    \end{cases},\] which has the support \(\overline{D(0,1)}\). Define the function \(\theta_\varepsilon(z)=\varepsilon^{-2}\theta\paren{\frac{z}{\varepsilon}}\) with the support \(\overline{D(0,\varepsilon)}\), which satisfies that \(\forall\varepsilon>0\), \[\int_{\mathbb{C}}\theta_\varepsilon(z)\ddx\wedge\ddy=1.\]
    Define a set of functions \(\cbraces{\beta_j(z)}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}\) with \(\beta_j(z)=\theta_{r_{z_j}}\paren{z-z_j}\), which is a bump function with the support \(\overline{D\paren{z_j, r_{z_j}}}\subset\Omega_{k_{z_j}}\). Equivalently, \(\cbraces{\supp\paren{\beta_j}}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}\) is locally finite on \(\Omega\). Consequently, a point \(z\in\Omega\) lies only in a finite number of sets of \(\cbraces{\supp\paren{\beta_j}}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}\). Then the sum \[S(z)=\sum_{j=1}^\infty\beta_j(z)\] is convergent, and since \(S(z)\) is strictly positive, the sequence defined by \[\cbraces{\alpha_j(z)}=\cbraces{\frac{\beta_j(z)}{S(z)}}\] is also \(C^\infty\) and is compactly supported in \(\Omega\). Furthermore, it satisfies \[\sum_{j=1}^\infty\alpha_j(z)=1.\]

\begin{theorem}[Existence of Bump Functions]\label{thm:bumpfunctionexistence}
    Let \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}\) be open, \(K\subset\Omega\) be compact, and \(V\subseteq\Omega\) be an open neighborhood of \(K\). Then there exists a bump function \(\varphi\in C^\infty\paren{\mathbb{C}}\) with compact support contained in \(V\) such that \(\forall z\in\mathbb{C}\), \(0\leq\varphi(z)\leq 1\), and there exists an open neighborhood of \(K\) over which \(\varphi\equiv1\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(V(K,\varepsilon)=\left\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,\middle|\,\inf_{\zeta\in K}\abs{\zeta-z}<\varepsilon\right\}\). In other words, \(z\) is within \(\varepsilon\) apart from \(K\).

    Then \(\exists\varepsilon>0\) such that \(K\subset V(K,\varepsilon)\subset V(K,2\varepsilon)\subseteq V\). Let \(\Omega_1=V(K,2\varepsilon)\) and \(\Omega_2=\Omega\setminus V(K,\varepsilon)\). Then there exists a \(C^\infty\) partition of unity \(\cbraces{\alpha_j(z)}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}\) of \(\Omega\) subordinate to the open cover \(\cbraces{\Omega_1,\Omega_2}\). Define a new function
    \[\varphi(z)=\sum_{\substack{j\in\mathbb{N}\\\supp{\alpha_j}\subseteq\Omega_1}}\alpha_j(z).\]
    It follows that \(\varphi\in C^\infty(\mathbb{C})\) with compact support in \(\Omega_1\). Since the support of every \(\alpha_j\) where \(j\in\mathbb{N}\) lies entirely either in \(\Omega_1\) or \(\Omega_2\), \[1=\sum_{\substack{j\in\mathbb{N}\\\supp{\alpha_j}\subseteq\Omega_2}}\alpha_j(z)+\varphi(z).\]
    When \(z\in\Omega_1\setminus\Omega_2=V(K,\varepsilon)\), the first summation vanishes, meaning that \(\varphi\equiv1\) on the neighborhood \(V(K,\varepsilon)\) of \(K\). When \(z\in\Omega_2\setminus\Omega_1=\Omega\setminus V(K,2\varepsilon)\), \(\varphi\) vanishes.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Zeroes of a Holomorphic Function}
We will introduce a fundamental application of Liouville's Theorem (\autoref{thm:liouville}) below.
\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]\label{thm:fundamentaltheoremofalgebra}
    Every non-constant polynomial \(p(z)\) with complex coefficients has at least one complex root; that is, there exists \(z_0\in\mathbb{C}\) such that \(p(z_0)=0\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For the sake of contradiction, suppose that \(p(z)\) has no complex roots. Then the function \(f(z)=\frac{1}{p(z)}\) is continuous and entire, because \(p(z)\) has no roots in \(\mathbb{C}\). Moreover, as \(|z|\to\infty\), \(p(z)\to\infty\), so \(f(z)\to 0\), and thus \(f(z)\) is bounded. By Liouville's Theorem (\autoref{thm:liouville}), every bounded entire function is constant. Thus, \(f(z)\) is constant, and so \(p(z)\) must also be constant. By contradiction, \(p(z)\) has at least one complex root.
\end{proof}

Laurent Series are a generalization of Taylor Series specifically for holomorphic functions over a region punctured by a non-removable singularity. Whereas the Taylor Series applies over a disk, the Laurent Series applies over an annulus around the singularity.
